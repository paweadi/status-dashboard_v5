Users attempting to use this model received an HTTP 400 error, resulting in 4.6% of total chat requests during this timeframe failing. Other models were not impacted.The issue was caused by a misconfiguration deployed to an internal service which made Claude Sonnet 4.5 unavailable. The problem was identified and mitigated by reverting the change. GitHub is working to improve cross-service deploy safeguards and monitoring to prevent similar incidents in the future.Nov28,08:23UTCUpdate-We have rolled out a fix and are monitoring for recovery.Nov28,07:52UTCUpdate-We are investigating degraded performance with the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model in Copilot.Nov28,07:04UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotNov28,06:59UTCNov27,2025No incidents reported.Nov26,2025No incidents reported.Nov25,2025No incidents reported.Nov24,2025Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-On November 24, 2025, between 12:15 and 15:04 UTC, Codespaces users encountered connection issues when attempting to create a codespace after choosing the recently released VS Code Codespaces extension, version 1.18.1. Users were able to downgrade to the 1.18.0 version of the extension during this period to work around this issue. At peak, the error rate was 19% of connection requests. This was caused by mismatching version dependencies for the released VS Code Codespaces extension.The connection issues were mitigated by releasing the VS Code Codespaces extension version 1.18.2 that addressed the issue. Users utilizing version 1.18.1 of the VS Code Codespaces extension are advised to upgrade to version >=1.18.2.We are improving our validation and release process for this extension to ensure functional issues like this are caught before release to customers and to reduce detection and mitigation times for extension issues like this in the future.Nov24,15:04UTCUpdate-Version 1.18.2 of the GitHub Codespaces VSCode extension has been released. This version should resolve the connection issues, and we are continuing to monitor success rate for Codespaces creation.Nov24,14:26UTCUpdate-We are testing a new version of the GitHub Codespaces VSCode extension that should resolve the connection issues, and expect that to be available in the next 30 minutes.Nov24,14:00UTCUpdate-Codespaces is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Nov24,13:26UTCUpdate-We are seeing Codespaces connection issues related to the latest version of the VSCode Codespaces extension (1.18.1). Users can select the 1.18.0 version of the extension to avoid issues (View -> Command Palette, run \"Extensions: Install specific version of Extension...\"), while we work to remove the affected version.Nov24,13:25UTCInvestigating-We are currently investigating this issue.Nov24,13:10UTCNov23,2025No incidents reported.Nov22,2025No incidents reported.Nov21,2025Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-Between November 19th, 16:13UTC and November 21st, 12:22UTC, the GitHub Enterprise Importer (GEI) service was in a degraded state, during which time, customers of the service experienced a delay when reclaiming mannequins post-migration.We have taken steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.Nov21,00:22UTCUpdate-Processing of these jobs has resumed.Nov21,00:22UTCUpdate-GitHub Enterprise Importer migration systems are currently impacted by a pause to Migration Mannequin Reclaiming.At 19:43 UTC on 2025-11-19, we paused the queue that processes Mannequin Reclaiming work done at the end of a migration.This was done after observing load that threatened the health of the overall system. The cause has been identified, and efforts to fix are underway.In the current state:- all requests to Reclaim Mannequins will be held in a queue- those requests will be processed when repair work is complete and the queue unpaused, at which time the incident will be closedThis does not impact processing of migration runs using GitHub Enterprise Importer, only mannequin reclamation.Nov19,16:13UTCInvestigating-We are currently investigating this issue.Nov19,16:13UTCNov20,2025Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-Between November 20, 2025 17:16 UTC to November, 2025 19:08 UTC some users experienced delayed or failed Git Operations for raw file downloads. On average, the error rate was less than 0.2%. This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting and are taking steps to improve our monitoring and time to mitigation for similar issues in the future.Nov20,19:24UTCUpdate-Mitigation has been applied and operations have returned to normal.Nov20,19:24UTCUpdate-We continue to see a small number of errors when accessing raw file content. We are deploying a mitigation.Nov20,18:44UTCUpdate-We're investigating elevated error rates for a small amount of customers when accessing raw file content.Nov20,18:05UTCInvestigating-We are currently investigating this issue.Nov20,18:04UTCNov19,2025Incident with ActionsResolved-On November 19, between 17:36 UTC and 18:04 UTC, GitHub Actions service experienced degraded performance that caused excessive latency in queueing and updating workflow runs and job statuses. Operations related to artifacts, cache, job steps and logs also had significantly increased latency. At peak, 67% of workflow jobs queued during that timeframe were impacted, and the median latency for impacted operations increased by up to 35x.This was caused by a significant change in load pattern on Actions Cache-related operations, leading to a saturated shared resource on the backend. The impact was mitigated by mitigating the new load pattern.To reduce the likelihood of a recurrence, we are improving rate-limiting measures in this area to ensure a more consistent experience for all customers.  We are also evaluating changes to reduce the scope of impact.Nov19,18:07UTCUpdate-We have applied mitigation and are seeing recoveryNov19,17:59UTCUpdate-We are investigating delays in actions runs and possible errors in artifact and cache creation.Nov19,17:56UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsNov19,17:48UTCNov18,2025Git operation failuresResolved-From Nov 18, 2025 20:30 UTC to Nov 18, 2025 21:34 UTC we experienced failures on all Git operations, including both SSH and HTTP Git client interactions, as well as raw file access. These failures also impacted products that rely on Git operations.The root cause was an expired TLS certificate used for internal service-to-service communication. We mitigated the incident by replacing the expired certificate and restarting impacted services. Once those services were restarted we saw a full recovery.We have updated our alerting to cover the expired certificate and are performing an audit of other certificates in this area to ensure they also have the proper alerting and automation before expiration. In parallel, we are accelerating efforts to eliminate our remaining manually managed certificates, ensuring all service-to-service communication is fully automated and aligned with modern security practices.Nov18,21:59UTCUpdate-Git Operations is operating normally.Nov18,21:56UTCUpdate-We are seeing full recovery after rolling out the fix and all services are operational.Nov18,21:55UTCUpdate-Codespaces is operating normally.Nov18,21:55UTCUpdate-We have shipped a fix and are seeing recovery in some areas and will continue to provide updates.Nov18,21:36UTCUpdate-We have identified the likely cause of the incident and are working on a fix. We will provide another update as we get closer to deploying the fix.Nov18,21:27UTCUpdate-Codespaces is experiencing degraded availability. We are continuing to investigate.Nov18,21:25UTCUpdate-We are currently investigating failures on all Git operations, including both SSH and HTTP.Nov18,21:11UTCUpdate-We are seeing failures for some git http operations and are investigatingNov18,20:52UTCUpdate-Git Operations is experiencing degraded availability. We are continuing to investigate.Nov18,20:39UTCInvestigating-We are currently investigating this issue.Nov18,20:39UTCDisruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-Between November 17, 2025 21:24 UTC and November 18, 2025 00:04 UTC the gists service was degraded and users were unable to create gists via the web UI. 100% of gist creation requests failed with a 404 response. This was due to a change in the web middleware that inadvertently triggered a routing error. We resolved the incident by rolling back the change. We are working on more effective monitoring to reduce the time it takes to detect similar issues and evaluating our testing approach for middleware functionality.Nov18,00:10UTCUpdate-We are investigating reports of 404s creating gists.Nov17,23:01UTCInvestigating-We are currently investigating this issue.Nov17,23:01UTC\u2190Incident HistoryPowered by Atlassian StatuspageGitHub text logoSubscribe to our developer newsletterGet tips, technical guides, and best practices.
