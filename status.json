Users attempting to use this model received an HTTP 400 error, resulting in 4.6% of total chat requests during this timeframe failing. Other models were not impacted.The issue was caused by a misconfiguration deployed to an internal service which made Claude Sonnet 4.5 unavailable. The problem was identified and mitigated by reverting the change. GitHub is working to improve cross-service deploy safeguards and monitoring to prevent similar incidents in the future.Nov28,08:23UTCUpdate-We have rolled out a fix and are monitoring for recovery.Nov28,07:52UTCUpdate-We are investigating degraded performance with the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model in Copilot.Nov28,07:04UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotNov28,06:59UTCNov27,2025No incidents reported.Nov26,2025No incidents reported.Nov25,2025No incidents reported.Nov24,2025Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-On November 24, 2025, between 12:15 and 15:04 UTC, Codespaces users encountered connection issues when attempting to create a codespace after choosing the recently released VS Code Codespaces extension, version 1.18.1. Users were able to downgrade to the 1.18.0 version of the extension during this period to work around this issue. At peak, the error rate was 19% of connection requests. This was caused by mismatching version dependencies for the released VS Code Codespaces extension.The connection issues were mitigated by releasing the VS Code Codespaces extension version 1.18.2 that addressed the issue. Users utilizing version 1.18.1 of the VS Code Codespaces extension are advised to upgrade to version >=1.18.2.We are improving our validation and release process for this extension to ensure functional issues like this are caught before release to customers and to reduce detection and mitigation times for extension issues like this in the future.Nov24,15:04UTCUpdate-Version 1.18.2 of the GitHub Codespaces VSCode extension has been released. This version should resolve the connection issues, and we are continuing to monitor success rate for Codespaces creation.Nov24,14:26UTCUpdate-We are testing a new version of the GitHub Codespaces VSCode extension that should resolve the connection issues, and expect that to be available in the next 30 minutes.Nov24,14:00UTCUpdate-Codespaces is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Nov24,13:26UTCUpdate-We are seeing Codespaces connection issues related to the latest version of the VSCode Codespaces extension (1.18.1). Users can select the 1.18.0 version of the extension to avoid issues (View -> Command Palette, run \"Extensions: Install specific version of Extension...\"), while we work to remove the affected version.Nov24,13:25UTCInvestigating-We are currently investigating this issue.Nov24,13:10UTC\u2190Incident HistoryPowered by Atlassian StatuspageGitHub text logoSubscribe to our developer newsletterGet tips, technical guides, and best practices.
